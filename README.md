</br>
Introduction-
    
    Cube-DeepRL is a Cube(3X3X6) Solver and Visualizer built from scratch using a Reinforcement Learning Agent and plotly.


Method-

    Cube Environment:
            Moves 
                    Roatating Clockwise-Rotating 3 smaller cube to the right
                    initial face = 1 2 3
                                   4 5 6
                                   7 8 9
                    rotated_face = 7 4 1
                                   8 5 2
                                   9 6 3
                    UP-Rotating the cube Clockwise from TOP side view
                    DOWN-Rotating the cube Clockwise from BOTTOM side view
                    RIGHT-Rotating the cube Clockwise from RIGHT side view
                    LEFT-Rotating the cube Clockwise from TOP side view
                    FRONT-Rotating the cube Clockwise from FRONT side view
                    BACK-Rotating the cube Clockwise from REAR side view


                Sides,Color and Repersentstion
                    Front-The Number representation is 1 and the color assigned is BLUE
                    Right-The Number representation is 2 and the color assigned is RED
                    Left-The Number representation is 3 and the color assigned is GREEN
                    Back-The Number representation is 4 and the color assigned is ORANGE
                    Up-The Number representation is 5 and the color assigned is YELLOW
                    Down-The Number representation is 6 and the color assigned is WHITE
